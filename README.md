This project is a web application demonstrating the use of facial recognition for marking attendance, scanning sentiment analysis and detecting drowsiness. It can be used by the company to manage attendance of its employees and generate attendance report/stats, along with using sentiment analyzer for detecting the employees's sentiments. Also it can detect drowsiness in drivers. This project was done during the internship at Tata Motors

Scope of the project: 
Facial recognition is becoming increasingly prominent in our society, significantly advancing the field of security. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of facial recognition technology by companies worldwide, aiming to reduce contact points for customers and staff. Unlike other biometric identifiers, such as fingerprint scanners and voice recognition, facial recognition is less time-consuming and less intrusive.
This project lays the groundwork for future endeavors involving facial detection and recognition. It also encompasses web development and database management, featuring a user-friendly interface. Using this system, corporate offices, schools, and organizations can replace traditional methods of employee attendance tracking and easily generate attendance reports. Also companies can analyze sentiments of the employees and detect drowsiness of the drivers, ensuring safety.
